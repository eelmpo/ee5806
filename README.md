4. Perform Video analysis
5. Apply computer algorithms to practical problems

## Syllabus

#### Basic Image Processing Methods
Image  sampling  and  quantization;  filtering  in  spatial  and  frequency  domains;  color  imaging;  contrast 
enhancement.

#### Image Transformations
The two-dimensional Fourier transform (2D DFT); principal component analysis; 2D autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) models; non-linear transforms.

#### Image Reconstruction and Restoration

Spatial  and  frequency  domain  representation  of  2D  signals; image  reconstruction  from  projections,  image reconstruction from Fourier magnitude information only or phase information only; medical imaging systems; projection onto convex sets for image reconstruction and restoration.

#### Image Segmentation and Pattern Recognition

Pattern  recognition  techniques;  image  segmentation;  point detection,   line  detection,  edge   detection; thresholding,  clustering,  region  growing  methods;  decision  function;  pattern  classification  by  distance  and maximum likelihood; training techniques; application of AI techniques.

#### Video Analysis

Kalman filtering, linear prediction, motion detection and estimation; point and line matching, object tracking; efficient computer algorithms.

#### Applications

Examples  include  artefact  removal  from  highly  compressed  images,  medical  image  reconstruction  from incomplete information, object detection, tracking and recognition.
